People who are new to krishna's community and societies like ISKCON might wonder who are they? called "GORNITHAI"!
Yes! you read it right! It's the word "are" and not "is". 
Although, we address as a single name "GORNITHAI", what actually meant is "GAURA and NITAI"!

Before I tell about "GAURA-NITAI", let's go back to the spread of krishna consiousness and the need to worship and chant. All of us believe that this Kaliyuga 
is witnessing an inumerable number of sins, filled with anger, jealousy, lies, sorrow, sufferrings, inhumanity, grief and what not!!!! Surviving in this world is 
not a cake walk. Constant worship and chanting the powerful mantra of the universe is believed to ease the path of crossing this kaliyuga and lessen the negative things 
that are bound to happen in this Yuga. Therefore, it's important for an individual like you and me to chant the mantra that gives us strength and spreads love.

Now comes the question, how is it known that mere worshipping and chanting help us ease the survival in KaliYuga? It was known by the preachings of two great saints called 
"GAURA" and "NITAI".

The story of Gaura-Nitai (also referred to as Gornitai) is rooted in the rich tradition of Gaudiya Vaishnavism and revolves around two key figures: 
Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (Gaura) and Sri Nityananda Prabhu (Nitai). Their lives and teachings aimed to revive bhakti (devotional love) for Lord Krishna 
during the 15th and 16th centuries in Bengal and neighboring regions.

Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (Gaura)

Birth and Early Life:
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, also known as Gaura (due to his golden complexion), was born as Vishvambhar Mishra in Nabadwip, Bengal, in 1486 on a 
full moon night during the Hindu festival of Phalguna Purnima.
His parents, Jagannath Mishra and Sachi Devi, were devout Brahmins.
As a child, he was called Nimai because he was born under a neem tree.
Nimai was exceptionally intelligent and mastered Sanskrit and scripture at a young age. However, he was mischievous and often teased the local scholars.
Transformation to Bhakti:

Around the age of 16, Nimai experienced a spiritual awakening after the death of his father and meeting Ishvara Puri, a renowned saint and scholar.
He began chanting the holy names of Krishna and inspiring others to do the same. This marked his transformation from a scholar to a devotional preacher.
Preaching the Holy Name:

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu initiated the Harinam Sankirtan movement, the congregational chanting of the holy names:
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare,
Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
He traveled extensively across India, spreading the message of unconditional love and devotion to Krishna.
Divine Identity:

Chaitanya is considered a combined incarnation of Radha and Krishna. He embodies Krishna's essence and Radha's devotion, making him unique among avatars.



Sri Nityananda Prabhu (Nitai)

Birth and Early Life:

Nityananda was born in Ekachakra, a small village in West Bengal, in 1474.
His parents, Hadai Pandit and Padmavati Devi, were simple and pious Brahmins.
As a child, Nitai was deeply spiritual and often enacted stories from the Mahabharata and Ramayana.
Meeting Chaitanya:

Nityananda left home at a young age and became a wandering monk, visiting holy places and seeking divine truth.
He met Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Nabadwip in 1506, a meeting that was said to have been predestined.
Upon meeting, the two recognized each other as eternal companions: Chaitanya as Krishna and Nityananda as Balarama.
Preaching Together:

Nityananda became Chaitanya’s closest associate and helped spread the Harinam Sankirtan movement.
Known for his unparalleled mercy, Nityananda approached even the most sinful people and delivered them through the holy name of Krishna.
A famous example of his mercy is the transformation of Jagai and Madhai, two notorious drunkards, into devout followers of Krishna.
Gaura-Nitai's Mission
Spreading Krishna Consciousness:

Their mission was to uplift humanity in the age of Kali Yuga (the age of quarrel and hypocrisy) by making devotion to Krishna accessible to everyone, 
regardless of caste, creed, or background.
They emphasized chanting the Maha Mantra as the simplest and most effective way to attain liberation.


Gaura’s Renunciation:
At the age of 24, Chaitanya took sannyasa (the renounced order of life) to set an example of detachment and dedication to Krishna.
He spent the rest of his life in Puri, Odisha, absorbed in the ecstasy of Krishna-prema (love for Krishna).
Nitai’s Compassion:

Nityananda did not take sannyasa. Instead, he continued to spread Krishna's message among householders and the common people.
He married Vasudha and Jahnava Devi, who also became prominent spiritual leaders.


Key Teachings of Gaura-Nitai
Chanting the Holy Name:
The chanting of Krishna’s name is the most powerful spiritual practice for this age.

Equality in Devotion:
They taught that everyone, regardless of social status, gender, or background, has an equal opportunity to develop love for Krishna.
Compassion:

Nityananda, in particular, exemplified boundless compassion by uplifting the most fallen souls.
Unity of Radha and Krishna:

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu revealed the ultimate truth that Krishna is the Supreme Lord, and devotion to him through Radha’s love is the highest spiritual attainment.
